## My Interests
I am a Software Developer who is very interested in Artificial Intelligence and streamlining the education of Computer Science.

## Personal Statement
Through several of my college courses I've found a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence and its applications. With the skills that I've gained from my senior project so far I hope to create useful AI powered applications for everyday life. Working in group projects and leading some of them have given me the skills to work efficiently in a team oriented setting and be able to plan and divide up work as necessary. My goal is to utilize AI to make the world run smoother.

Along with my interest in Artificial Intelligence, I have a great interest in Computer Science education.  And finding and developing new tools to assist with the learning process.  This interest is reflected in my senior thesis project. Which can be viewed [here](../projects)
